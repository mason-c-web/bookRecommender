# BookRecommender ðŸ“š
## Intro
Book Recommender (better name TBD) will be a web app design to recommend people books based on Clare (and Max's?) favorite reads. The perfect things to send to friends when they say they want to read more.
## Features
### Library
The BR library allows users to view all the books that Clare/Max has read and recommend. This will include a photo, rating, and description for each book. We should also have the ablilty to sort by type.
### Quiz
With our incrediable book recommending algorithm, a user can take a quiz that will recommend them a option. 
## Design
TBD on what this should look like. If we are using react something like material UI might make sense for tooling. 
## Technologies
- Google Docs API as sudo database
- React on the front end(?)
- javascript
- Hosted on Clare's URL
